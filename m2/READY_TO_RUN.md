## Next Steps to Run on Cluster

### Step 1: Build and Test OpenMP

```bash
# On the cluster
cd ~/cosc3500/milestone-1/cosc3500-m1-kmeans/m2

# Build OpenMP version
make openmp

# Quick test locally
./kmeans_openmp -N 10000 -D 16 -K 8 -I 10 -S 42 -T 4 --verbose
```

### Step 2: Submit OpenMP Benchmark

```bash
# From repository root
sbatch m2-scripts/slurm/openmp_baseline.slurm
```

This will:
- Test with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 threads
- Run canonical, stress, and medium configurations
- Generate CSV files in `m2-bench/openmp/`
- Take approximately 15 minutes

### Step 3: Submit CPU vs GPU Comparison (Optional)

```bash
sbatch m2-scripts/slurm/comparison_cpu_gpu.slurm
```

This compares:
- Serial baseline
- OpenMP (multiple thread counts)
- CUDA
- Generates comparison CSV

## OpenMP Implementation Details

### Key Features

**1. Optimizations Carried Forward from M1:**
- Transposed centroids (E1 optimization)
- Branchless minimum finding (E2 optimization)
- Double precision accumulation

**2. OpenMP-Specific Optimizations:**
- Static scheduling for consistent performance
- Thread-private accumulation buffers (avoid false sharing)
- Reduction clause for inertia computation
- NUMA-aware memory initialization

**3. Scalability:**
- Tests 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 threads
- Strong scaling analysis (fixed problem size)
- Expected: Linear speedup up to ~8 threads, sublinear beyond

### Expected OpenMP Performance

Based on typical CPU parallelization:

| Configuration | Serial (ms) | OpenMP 32T (ms) | Expected Speedup |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Canonical | 18.604 | ~1.2 | **15-20x** |
| Stress | 292.040 | ~15 | **15-20x** |

**Note**: OpenMP will be slower than CUDA but faster than serial.

## Correctness Verification

### CUDA (Already Verified âœ…)

**Inertia Convergence** (Stress config, seed=42):
```
Iteration 1:  6.146236e+06
Iteration 2:  2.756283e+06  (-55%)
Iteration 10: 2.463756e+06  (monotonic âœ“)
Iteration 20: 2.463752e+06  (converging âœ“)
```

### OpenMP (To Be Verified)

When you run OpenMP, check that:
1. **Monotonic convergence**: Inertia decreases each iteration
2. **Consistent results**: Same seed gives same final inertia
3. **Thread safety**: No race conditions (results match across runs)

## Expected Timeline

### OpenMP Baseline Job (~15 minutes)
```
Building: 1 minute
Thread scaling tests (1,2,4,8,16,32): 12 minutes
Output generation: 1 minute
```

### What You'll Get

```

## Analysis for Presentation

### Key Metrics to Calculate

**1. Speedup Analysis:**
```
Serial â†’ OpenMP (32 threads): ~15-20x
Serial â†’ CUDA: ~70-77x
OpenMP (32 threads) â†’ CUDA: ~4-5x
```

**2. Amdahl's Law Validation:**
```
Parallel fraction: Measure from assign kernel %
Theoretical max speedup: Calculate
Achieved speedup: Compare with theory
```

**3. Gustafson's Law:**
```
Scaled speedup: As problem size increases
Memory bandwidth: Compare CPU vs GPU
```

**4. Efficiency:**
```
OpenMP efficiency = Speedup / Num_threads
CUDA efficiency = Speedup / (Num_SMs Ã— Warps)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If OpenMP Build Fails

```bash
# Check compiler supports OpenMP
g++ --version
echo |cpp -fopenmp -dM |grep -i open

# Manual build
cd m2
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp -Iinclude \
    src/openmp/kmeans_openmp.cpp \
    src/openmp/main_openmp.cpp \
    src/common/kmeans_common.cpp \
    -o kmeans_openmp -lm
```

### If SLURM Job Fails

**Check time limits:**
```bash
sacctmgr show qos format=name,MaxWall
```

**Reduce test cases if needed:**
Edit `m2-scripts/slurm/openmp_baseline.slurm` and remove some thread counts or configurations.

### If Performance is Unexpected

**OpenMP threads not spawning:**
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=32
./kmeans_openmp ... --verbose
# Should print "OpenMP configuration: 32 threads"
```

**CUDA using wrong kernel:**
Check output for "Using shared memory kernel" or "Using basic kernel"
