## 📈 Analysis for Presentation

### Key Points to Highlight

**1. Technology Comparison (M2 Focus)**
- CUDA: 76.7x speedup on stress configuration
- OpenMP: Expected 15-20x speedup
- Clear demonstration of when GPU >> CPU

**2. Amdahl's Law**
```
Serial fraction (assign kernel): 86-91% of M1 runtime
Parallel fraction: 0.90
Theoretical max speedup: 1/(0.10) = 10x (infinite processors)
CUDA achieved: 76.7x (why? Different computation model)
```

**3. Gustafson's Law**
```
As problem size increases (N, K, D):
- CUDA speedup improves (stress > canonical)
- Memory bandwidth becomes less limiting
- Parallel work dominates
```

**4. Bottleneck Analysis**
- M1: Assign kernel (91% of time)
- CUDA: Update kernel (canonical) or balanced (stress)
- Identified: Atomic contention in update kernel

**5. Optimization Techniques**
- Shared memory: 100x faster than global
- Thread-private buffers: Avoid false sharing
- Branchless operations: Warp synchronization
- Carried forward M1 optimizations: Works across platforms

## 🔍 Correctness Verification

### CUDA (Verified ✅)

**Test**: Stress configuration, seed=42
```
Iteration 1:  6.146236e+06  (initial)
Iteration 2:  2.756283e+06  (-55% - large improvement)
Iteration 10: 2.463756e+06  (monotonic decrease ✓)
Iteration 20: 2.463752e+06  (converging ✓)
```

**Result**: Proper K-means clustering with correct convergence

### OpenMP (To Be Verified)

**When running, check**:
1. Final inertia matches CUDA (same seed)

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical

1. **Shared memory is critical on GPU**: 100x speedup over global memory
2. **Atomic contention matters**: Update kernel bottleneck for small K
3. **Memory bandwidth ≠ bottleneck**: Only 4.3% utilization on A100
4. **Thread-private buffers**: Essential for OpenMP performance
5. **M1 optimizations transfer**: Branchless, transposed layout work everywhere

### Methodological

1. **Profile before optimizing**: Assign kernel was 91% of M1 time
2. **Verify correctness continuously**: Inertia tracking catches bugs early
3. **Start simple, optimize incrementally**: Basic kernel → shared memory → ...
4. **Document as you go**: Easier than retroactive documentation
5. **Reproducible benchmarks**: SLURM scripts + CSV output = reproducible

### Project Management

1. **Plan matters**: M2 plan (claude.md) guided implementation
2. **Incremental commits**: Easy to track progress and revert if needed
3. **Test early, test often**: CUDA verified before moving to OpenMP
4. **Clear directory structure**: m2/, m2-docs/, m2-bench/ separation
5. **Comprehensive documentation**: 26 pages >> 5 pages minimum

## 🎓 Interview Preparation

### Questions to Expect

**1. "Explain your CUDA kernel design"**

**2. "Why is CUDA faster than OpenMP?"**

**3. "What is Amdahl's law and how does it apply?"**
- Answer: Speedup limited by serial fraction, our case: 91% parallel → 10x max (but GPU is different model)

**4. "What would you optimize next?"**
- Answer: Replace atomic updates with reduction, improve memory coalescing, use texture memory

**5. "How did you verify correctness?"**
- Answer: Inertia monotonic convergence, consistent results, matches M1 serial behavior

**6. "Why OpenMP for comparison?"**
